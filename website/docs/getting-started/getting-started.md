# Getting Started

Welcome to KiviGo! This guide will help you get up and running with KiviGo's key-value store library in just a few minutes.

## What is KiviGo?

KiviGo is a lightweight, modular key-value store library for Go that provides a unified interface for different backends (Redis, BadgerDB, Consul, etcd, etc.) and encoders (JSON, YAML). Each backend is implemented as a separate Go module to minimize dependencies.

## Why KiviGo?

- **🔄 Unified Interface**: Switch between backends without changing your code
- **📦 Modular Design**: Each backend is a separate module - only install what you need
- **🎯 Type Safety**: Automatic marshaling/unmarshaling of Go types
- **🧪 Testing Ready**: Built-in mock backend for unit testing
- **⚡ Performance**: Optimized for both embedded and distributed scenarios
- **🛡️ Reliable**: Comprehensive error handling and health checks

## Quick Overview

Here's what working with KiviGo looks like:

```go
// Setup is backend-specific
client, err := kivigo.New(backend)

// But usage is always the same
err = client.Set(ctx, "key", value)    // Store any Go type
err = client.Get(ctx, "key", &value)   // Retrieve into any Go type
keys, err := client.List(ctx, prefix)  // List keys by prefix
err = client.Delete(ctx, "key")        // Remove data
```
